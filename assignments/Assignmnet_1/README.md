## How to Compile & Start

1. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts in your terminal.

2. Run the script for Task 1:

   ```bash
   python task_1_scaling.py
   ```

3. Run the script for Task 2:

   ```bash
    python3 task_2_simulation_trial.py
    python3 task_2_B.py
   ```

The scripts will execute the simulations and generate the required plots as image files in the `output` directory. Console output will provide specific results and progress information.
